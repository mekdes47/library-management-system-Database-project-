# Library Management System - Database Design

## Project Overview  
The Library Management System is a database-driven solution designed to manage the operations of a library efficiently. This project focuses on creating a structured and optimized database design, including an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** and its corresponding **Relational Schema**, to illustrate the relationships and dependencies between data entities.

### Key Features:
- Tracks library members and their borrowing activity.
- Manages an inventory of books and resources.
- Maintains staff records for library administration.
- Provides a systematic approach to ensure data consistency and integrity.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)  

The ERD serves as a visual representation of the database structure, highlighting the following core entities and their relationships:

### Core Entities:
1. **Books**: Stores details about the library's collection, such as title, author, ISBN, and category.  
2. **Members**: Maintains records of registered library users, including their contact information and membership details.  
3. **Staff**: Captures information about library personnel and their roles.  
4. **Borrowing Transactions**: Tracks the borrowing and returning of books by members, including due dates and late fees.  
5. **Categories**: Groups books into genres or classifications.  

### Relationships:
- **Books and Categories**: A one-to-many relationship where each book belongs to one category, but a category can contain multiple books.
- **Members and Borrowing Transactions**: A one-to-many relationship as a member can borrow multiple books over time.
- **Staff and Borrowing Transactions**: A one-to-many relationship where staff assist in processing multiple transactions.

## Relational Schema  

The relational schema translates the ERD into database tables with defined attributes and primary/foreign key relationships.

### Tables and Attributes:

1. **Books**  
   - `book_id` (Primary Key)  
   - `title`  
   - `author`  
   - `isbn`  
   - `category_id` (Foreign Key)

2. **Categories**  
   - `category_id` (Primary Key)  
   - `category_name`  

3. **Members**  
   - `member_id` (Primary Key)  
   - `name`  
   - `email`  
   - `phone`  
   - `membership_date`

4. **Staff**  
   - `staff_id` (Primary Key)  
   - `name`  
   - `email`  
   - `role`

5. **Borrowing_Transactions**  
   - `transaction_id` (Primary Key)  
   - `book_id` (Foreign Key)  
   - `member_id` (Foreign Key)  
   - `staff_id` (Foreign Key)  
   - `borrow_date`  
   - `return_date`  
   - `late_fees`

## How to Use  

1. **ERD**: Review the ERD diagram to understand the logical flow and relationships between entities.  
2. **Relational Schema**: Use the relational schema as a blueprint for creating the database tables.  
3. **Implementation**: Create the database using any RDBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) by defining the tables and establishing primary/foreign key constraints.  

---

## Tools Used  
- **ERD Design**: [Tool name, e.g., Lucidchart, draw.io, or DB Designer]  
- **Programming Language (optional)**: [Language used for database integration, e.g., Python, Java]

---

## Future Enhancements  
- Implement additional modules such as book reservations and fines automation.  
- Develop a front-end interface for seamless interaction with the database.  
- Integrate reporting tools to generate insights on book usage and member activity.
